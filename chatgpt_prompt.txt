ChatGPT Prompt:
  
I would like to create a Shiny Dashboard that is (1) professional looking, (2) has different pages and,
(3) each page represents a "step" in an analysis.  Here are the steps:

Step 1: Defining an "Abnormal" Event
Step 2: Identifying Past Abnormal Events
Step 3: Exploring "Time Since" Events
Step 4: Exploring the Time Differences Between Events
Step 5: Exploring How Abnormal Events Impact Stock Returns

The page should have a red and blue theme, using low alpha versions of these colors.  
It should look professional.  Each page should have a template that looks like: 
Header

ggplotply

ggplotly
